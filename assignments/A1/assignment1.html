                Hi everyone! My name is <span class="bold">David Cardona</span>.<br />
                I was born in Colombia and I live in Newton, MA.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a Harvard Extension School Digital Media Design ALM student, and I aim to complete my studies by the end of this year.
            </p>

                My development background has evolved over the years. A simplified timeline is:
                <ul>
                    <li>I am a musician/music producer, and I needed an online portfolio, but building a website in Wix and Squarespace wasn't ideal for me. I asked a friend for help, and he set up a simple page in Wordpress based on a <a href="https://themeforest.net/" class="remove_underline">theme forest</a> template.</li>
                    <li>I took a <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/web/2022/spring/">web programming class</a> in Python/Django and Javascript at Harvard Extension School, where I designed a new version of my portfolio without relying on any themes.</li>
                    <li>After completing the class, I went on to publish <a href="https://soundarchitect.herokuapp.com" class="remove_underline">my portfolio</a> on Heroku, and updated the structure and design, further exploring CSS and Django.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div><hr />
        <div>
            <p>
                I have been blessed with many travels over my life, and it's hard to pick between Turkey, New Zealand, and Iceland. Choosing one makes no justice to the rest, but the sense of peace and belonging that I felt in the Black Sand beach in southern Iceland is worth highlighting. It is a place that certainly brought to life the mystical tales and stories of Nordic traditions.

                I am also a big fan of good food (who isn't?), from small cafes to fancy restaurants. As with my favorite place, I struggle to pick just one since they are scattered around the world. However, in the Boston area it is worth mentioning <a href="https://ostraboston.com/" class="remove_underline">Ostra</a> and <a href="https://fogodechao.com/location/boston/" class="remove_underline">Fogo de Chao</a>.
